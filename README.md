This sits on top of my other Flutterby code to provide the CMS for
Flutterby.com. I'm trying to catch up and make this what's actually
deployed. No guarantees it'll be useful for anyone, all the caveats in
the Flutterby repo about how this works but was written over a decade
ago still stand.

Also note that as of this first commit, there's no way to really turn
this into a running system. The tree has changed, the install script
hasn't been updated, and credentials are splattered all over in a way
that makes me reluctant to check code in until I actually figure out
how I'm going to do this.
